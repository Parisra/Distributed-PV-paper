	\subsection*{S1.1 PyPSA model and power flow optimization}
	
	A brief explanation on the PyPSA model is provided here. Comprehensive information about the optimization method, the objective function, and the constraints implemented in the model can be found in previous studies \citeS{neumann2022assessments_S, brown2017_S, horsch2018pypsa_S} as well as the model documentation \citeS{pypsa_docs_S}. The main goal of the optimization is to minimise the total annualized system costs. These costs include investment costs and operation and maintenance costs for all system components, as shown in Eq.(1), where \(c_{*}\) is capital cost of the component, \(o_{*}\) is operating cost of the component, \(G_{i,r}\) is generator capacity of technology \(r\) at location \(i\), \(E_{i,s}\) is energy capacity of storage \(s\) at location \(i\), \(P_{l}\) is transmission line capacity for line \(l\), \(F_{k}\) is power capacity of technology \(k\) for conversion and transportation of energy, \(g_{i,r,t}\) is generator dispatch of technology \(r\)  at time \(t\), and \(f_{k,t}\) is dispatch of technology \(k\) at time \(t\). Each time snapshot \(t\) is weighted by the time-step \(w_{t}\), and the sum of time-steps is one year.
	\begin{equation*}
		\min_{G,F,E,P,g,f} = \left[ \sum_{i,r}^{}c_{i,r}.G_{i,r} + \sum_{k}^{}c_{k}.F_{k}+ \sum_{i,s}^{}c_{i,s}.E_{i,s}+ 
		\sum_{l}^{}c_{l}.P_{l}+ 
		\right.
	\end{equation*}
	\begin{equation}
		\left.\sum_{i,r,t}^{}w_{t}\left(\sum_{i,r}^{}o_{i,r}.g_{i,r,t}+\sum_{k}^{}o_{k}.f_{k,t}  \right)   \right]
	\end{equation}
	
	A set of constraints are also added to the optimization problem. One of the constraints is that demand is inelastic and must therefore be met completely at each time-step. Other constraints represent different physical and societal limitations such as the maximum renewable potential in every node, maximum transmission expansion, available renewable and non-renewable resources, maximum storage discharge and charge dispatch, and maximum carbon emissions. The objective function and all the constraints are linear, which leads to a linear programme (LP). 
	The power flow in the network goes through two main elements: transmission network, and distribution grid. 
	Transmission network is comprised of High Voltage Alternating Current (HVAC) lines connecting high-voltage (HV) buses together, as shown in the simplified example in Figure S1. Distribution grid is represented as a single bidirectional connections between each HV bus to its corresponding low-voltage (LV) bus in the same node. 
	The simplest way to model power flow is to use the transport model, also known as network flow model. In this case we ignore all physical features of the power transmission such as line resistance and impedance, and only enforce ‘conservation of power’. This is done through the nodal power balance constraint that is modelled with Kirchhoff’s Current Law (KCL), as shown Eq.(2). The KCL constraint ensures that the total inflow power at each bus is equal to the total outflow power plus consumed power.
	\begin{equation}
		p_{i} = \sum_{l}^{} K_{il}.p_{l}   \quad\quad   \forall i \in \mathcal{N}
	\end{equation}
	where \(p_{i}\) is the active power injected or consumed at node \(i\), and \(K\) is the incidence matrix of the network graph which summarizes all connections between other nodes and node \(i\) as: not connected (0), connected with start at \(i\) (+1), and connected with end at \(i\) (-1). The power flowing through every line \(p_{l,t}\) is limited by the capacity of the line \(P_{l}\) as shown in Eq.(3), a capacity which is co-optimized if transmission expansion is allowed, as shown in Eq.(4).
	\begin{equation}
		\left | p_{l,t}  \right | \leq \bar{{p_{l}}}P_{l} \quad\quad   \forall l,t
	\end{equation}
	The inclusion of  \(\bar{p_{l}}\) as an extra per-unit security margin on the line capacity serves to provide a buffer to account for potential failures of individual circuits (as per the N-1 criterion) and reactive power flows. 
	\begin{equation}
		\sum_{l}^{} l_{l}.P_{l}\leq CAP_{LV} \quad\leftrightarrow \quad\mu_{LV}
	\end{equation}
	where the sum of transmission capacities \(P_{l}\) multiplied by the lengths \(l_{l}\) is bounded by a transmission volume cap of \(CAP_{LV}\). The Lagrange/KKT multiplier \(\mu_{LV}\) represents the shadow price of a marginal increase in transmission volume. As discussed in previous studies \citeS{neumann2022assessments_S}, the transport model does not have enough constraints to produce a unique solution, and this results in arbitrary flows in the network because it does not cost the model anything to transmit power. It also means that the model does not capture possible bottlenecks in the network.
	
	A better representation of the physical features of the power network, while keeping the problem linear, can be obtained with linearised optimal power flow (LOPF) equations, also known as DC power flow. This model adds linear constraints for Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law (KVL) to the KCL constraint of the transport model. The KVL constraint imposes the physical relation between the voltage differences at the extreme of a transmission line and the power flowing through it. The main assumptions behind LOPF are that power flows primarily accordingly to angle differences, no significant voltage shift occurs between the nodes, and line resistances are negligible compared to line reactance\citeS{neumann2022assessments_S}. Along with some other simplifying assumptions, the KVL constraint can be linearised to calculate the power flow \(p_{i}\) in each line with Eq.(3):
	\begin{equation}
		p_{l} = \frac{\Theta_{i}-\Theta_{j}}{x_{l}}
	\end{equation}
	where \(\Theta_{i}\) and \(\Theta_{j}\) are voltage angles at nodes \(i\) and \(j\), and \(x_{l}\) is the line reactance. In the model, KVL is imposed by means of the cycle matrix where \(C_{lc}\) contains information on which line \(l\) is an element of a closed loop \(c\) \citeS{neumann2022assessments_S}.
	\begin{equation}
		\sum_{l}^{} C_{lc}P_{l}x_{l}=0 \quad \forall c\in C
	\end{equation}
	Although LOPF improves upon the transport model by including reactance and voltage angles into the model, it also assumes negligible resistance, so power flow in the transmission network in our model is effectively lossless.
	\begin{figure}[H]
		\renewcommand*{\thefigure}{S\arabic{figure}}
		\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth,center]{./figure S0}
		\caption{Schematic of connections between two high-voltage and low-voltage nodes in the network. Transmission lines are modeled using LOPF equations and line capacity \(P_{l}\) is optimized assuming zero resistive losses. Distribution grid connections are modeled using the Transport model and  capacity \(P_{l}\) is optimized assuming a constant efficiency of \(\eta_{D}\). }
	\end{figure}
	Modeling the network with LOPF is significantly more demanding computationally than using the transport model. To minimise computational complexity, only the transmission network, meaning all AC and DC HV transmission lines between HV buses, are modelled with LOPF. The assumptions behind LOPF are also more reasonable when looking at transmission lines. The distribution grid is modelled as a single connections between the HV bus and LV bus for each node with the transport model, so the only constraint that applies to it is the KCL constraint. To represent power flow losses in the distribution network, a constant efficiency is assumed for all distribution connections, which could be 100\% or 90\% (10\% power losses) as mentioned in the text. 
	
	\subsection*{S1.2 PyPSA model demand caclulation}
	
	\textbf{Electricity Demand}
	
	The data on hourly electricity demand at the national level is obtained through the interface of the Open Power System Data (OPSD) initiative, specifically for the reference year 2013 as published by ENTSO-E. The existing electricity consumption for heating purposes is deducted from this demand, enabling a separate optimization of power-to-heat options. Additionally, the current electricity demand from the industrial sector is subtracted and managed independently, taking into account potential further electrification within this sector. Geographical data from the industrial database developed within the Hot maps project is utilized to distribute the electricity demand for the industry. The remaining electricity demand for households and services is allocated within each country based on proportional considerations of GDP and population. There is no distinction made between rural vs. urban areas or residential vs services buildings when electricity demand is allocated to each node \citeS{pypsa_eur_sec_docs_S,neumann2023potential_S}.
	
	\textbf{Heat demand}
	
	The regional resolution of building heating in residential and service sectors encompasses both individual buildings and district heating systems. JRC-IDEES provides annual heat demands per country, which are then divided into space and water heating categories. In the case of space heating, the annual demands are transformed into daily values through the atlite tool, utilizing population-weighted Heating Degree Day (HDD). The space heat demand is proportionate to the difference between the daily average ambient temperature (extracted from ERA5), and a specified threshold temperature (15 °C by default), beyond which space heat demand is considered zero. The daily space heat demand is allocated to different hours of the day based on heat demand profiles from BDEW, with distinctions for weekdays and weekends/holidays, as well as between residential and service demands \citeS{pypsa_eur_sec_docs_S}. 
	
	\subsection*{S2. Distribution grid modeling}
	
	Some small-scale studies consider several levels for the grid with a high-high voltage level for transmission network and lower levels (high, medium, low) for distribution grid \citeS{muller_2019_S}. In our model we consider only one HV level and one LV level per node. Another approach to modelling the distribution grid is to use 2 unidirectional connections instead of one bidirectional connection\citeS{clack_2020_S}. This was tested for the scenario B under different transmission and distribution grid assumptions, as shown in Figure S2. The results showed no significant difference for system capacity mix. This is due to the fact that reverse flows in the distribution grid are very low and the system does not consider it cost-efficient to install any capacity for this direction. Hence, we follow a simple approach using one bidirectional connection.
	A number of studies including grid reinforcement costs are shown in Table S1. Some of these studies represent grid costs as €/m for distribution lines, or as €/kWh for the amount of energy transfer through the distribution grid. To convert these costs to the unit €/kW, the following is assumed for the European distribution grid : 300 million customers, 10 millions km of power lines, 2800 annual TWh demand \citeS{rullaud2020distribution_S} and 542 GW peak hourly demand \citeS{ENTSOE_2017_S}
	Let us assume that we have a cost of 1 €/km for distribution grid. We can multiply this by the number 10 million (km), which would result in 10 million € as the total cost of the distribution grids in Europe. We can then divide this number by the European energy system peak load, which is 542 GW, and the resulting number could be considered the cost of the distribution grid in €/kW. This methodology is rather crude, so only the studies where the numbers fall within an established criterion are presented here.

Energy generation figures both show that wind generation is increasing for higher transmission network capacity, compensating for the reduction in solar energy. Due to easy transportation of energy from locations with high wind potential, although installed wind capacity decreases for optimal transmission allowances, wind energy generation continues to increase.

		\caption{Comparison of system costs for sector-coupled scenario with high distributed PV potential (3000 GW) with and without distributed technologies where distribution grid losses are 7\% and distribution grid cost is 500 €/KW. Cost savings (2.1\%) are less significant compared to scenario D (3.7\% savings) where assumptions for the distribution grid are 10\% losses and 1000 €/KW costs. However, the system still installs 1900 GW of distributed PV, which is 43\% of the total installed solar capacity equal to 4400 GW. This shows that even with more conservative assumptions regarding distribution grid, distributed solar is still profitable for the system. }

		\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth,center]{./figure S30}
		\caption{Comparison of total system costs without (left columns) and with (right columns) distributed technologies for the scenarios B, C, and D using three different weather years. These three years were selected from 37 weather year data to represent different resource availability of wind and solar. Year 1992 has a high wind resource, year 2000 has a high solar resource, and year 2018 has average wind and solar resource. The cost savings and system generation mix (shown in next figure) experience slight changes, but the overall results regarding cost reductions and installed capacity of distributed PV remains the same. }

		\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth,center]{./figure S31}
		\caption{Comparison of system capacity mix without (left columns) and with (right columns) distributed technologies for the scenarios B, C, and D using three different weather years. The installed capacity of distributed solar compared to the base scenario B (weather year 2013) changes 3.3\% for 1992, 11.8\% for 2000, and -9.2\% for 2018. The changes are very small for scenario C (maximum 0.3\%), since the maximum capacity of distributed solar is used in this scenario as mentioned in the main text. The changes for scenario D are 29.5\%, 30.6\%, and -13.7\% for 1992, 2000, and 2018, respectively. Therefore, year 2018 has lower installed capacity of distributed solar (1872 GW) compared to the 2170 GW from base scenario D, but it still has higher cost savings as a result of a different system capacity mix. }
